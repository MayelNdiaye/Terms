  <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>
  <p>This application is an internal automation script built using the WhatsApp Cloud API. It does not collect, store, or manage personal user data.</p>
  <p>Because no personal data is collected or stored, there is no user data to delete.</p>
  <p>If you believe your information has been shared with this app by mistake or wish to request deletion of any related data, please contact the app owner using the email address associated with the Meta Developer account.</p>
